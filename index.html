    <h1>Full styling for select boxes. No jQuery.</h1>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standalone</strong> - runs on its own without any dependencies. If you're using vanilla JS and want to style a select box, you've come to the right place.</li>
      <li><strong>Correct</strong> - Triggers 'change' events on real select boxes so you won't have to modify your existing event listeners.</li>
      <li><strong>Usable with the keyboard</strong> - Appears in tab index, space shows and hides the options, up and down arrow changes the highlight option, enter selects the currently highlighted option.</li>
      <li><strong>Fully styled, and designed to be customised</strong> - There are a number of <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2011/03/custom-select-drop-downs-with-css3/">CSS-only ways to style a select box</a>, but these don't style the drop down options, just the current selection - StyleSelect styles everything. StyleSelect is designed for easy incorporation into your own look and feel, uses SCSS, and is free of magic numbers, CSS 'triangles', images, and other hacks. </li>
      <li><strong>Accessable</strong> - people using screen readers simply experience the regular, unstyled select box.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>StyleSelect was made when looking for a modern equivalent of <a href="http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen">Chosen</a> and <a href="http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/">Selectize</a> for a project where jQuery wasn't used.<p>

    <h2>Demo</h2>

    <p>So we've included `styleselect.scss` in our SASS and loaded the AMD module. To style a select box, just run `styleSelect` with a CSS-style selector:</p>

    <code>styleSelect('select.some-class');</code>

    <p>That's all. Here's one we just made: </p>

    <select>
      <option value="value1">Label 1</option>
      <option value="value2" selected>Label 2</option>
      <option value="value3">Label 3</option>
    </select>

    <p class="result"></p>

    <p>Simple. From here on you'll probably want to open <strong>styleselect.scss</strong> and tweak styling.</p>
